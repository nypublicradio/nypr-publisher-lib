## Mirage Support

This addon also provides support for local development using [ember-cli-mirage](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com). The models, factories, and serializers in this addon are made available to consuming apps by following [the advice outlined in this comment here](https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage/issues/899#issuecomment-327255864).

For a consuming app to include these pieces, a config must be added to the `ember-cli-build.js` file, like so:
```
// ember-cli-build.js

/* eslint-env node */
'use strict';

const EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    ...
    'mirage-support': {
      includeAll: true
    }
    ...
  });
  
  return app.toTree();
};
```

As long as `ember-cli-mirage` is not disabled, the files in this addon's `mirage-support` directory will be merged with the consuming app's namespace, and be made available to that mirage context.

The `'mirage-support'` key has 3 options:

Key | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`includeAll` | `Boolean` | If `true`, includes the full `mirage-support` tree, i.e. no-brainer just use it all.
`exclude` | _{Array of `GlobStrings,RegExps,Functions`}_ | This value gets passed directly to `broccoli-funnel`, *only* if `includeAll` is specified. Allows for excluding certain files from import.
`include` | _{Array of `GlobStrings,RegExps,Functions`}_ | Passed dirctly to `broccoli-funnel`. Allows to pick only certain files to be imported into app namespace.

### You Must Create a `confg/mirage.js` file
There is still active work on `ember-cli-mirage` to allow for importing third-party config files. Until that work is done, consuming apps *must* specify the routes they will use in testing and development.
